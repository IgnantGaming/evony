Servers that reach {1:S} days and have had the first King can participate in the Server War.  Two Servers will be matched and players will be informed by mail before the Server War. 3. When the Server War begins, a player whose Keep reaches level 7 can use a Server Teleporter to teleport to a random spot of the enemy Server.  The system will give free Server Teleporter to everyone upon the beginning of each Server War. 4. Killing enemies and Monsters and occupying the City of Throne and Temples from the enemy Server will gain you Server War scores.  Killing enemies from your own Server does not offer you any scores.  A player will receive rewards when he meets the scores and ranking requirements.  The Monarch Scores require a minimum of {2:S} and the Alliance Scores require a minimum of {3:S}.  The Server that has won the Server War will have extra Gems Mine on the world map. 5. Three Temples unlock at the beginning of Server War.  Occupying a Temple of enemy Server will gain you Server War Scores.  If a Temple is occupied by the enemy Server for up to {4:S} hours and above and your Server loses the Server War, then the Temple will debuff all players within 2 days after the Server War ends.  If a Temple is occupied by the enemy Server for less than {5:S} hours and your Server wins the Server War, then the Temple will buff and reward all players within 2 days after the Server War ends. 6. The SvS Throne War opens 24 hours after Server War opens.  Occupying the City of Throne of enemy Server can gain you Server War Scores.  And occupying it for {6:S} hours in a row will transfer 50% of enemy Server's final Server War Scores to your own Server!  Meanwhile, the occupier will become the conqueror of the enemy Server and receive a special avatar frame.  The enemy Server's City of Throne will have no King before until the next Throne War. 7. If the SvS Throne War is still ongoing upon the end of Server War, there will be another {7:S} hour Throne War for players of your own Server, during which if the war still cannot end, then last King still remains the King. (If there is no King in the last round, there is no King in this round either.) 8. The victory Server of Server War will receive a rewards pool if meeting the scores requirement.  Players who reach {8:S} scores can share the rewards according to their scores amount.  While the defeated Server can only get half of the rewards pool. 9. During the Server War, a player cannot use Truce Agreement in the enemy Server but will receive a short time Truce Agreement upon teleporting to the enemy Server.  A player's Subordinate Cities cannot be attacked when the player is in the enemy Server. 10. During the Server War, a player in the enemy Server will be sent back when his Walls HP reaches zero, or when the Server War ends.  The player can also use an Adv Teleporter to return to his Server at any time. 11. During the Server War, the Hospital Capacity will be increased by {9:S}, and then will be back to normal when the Server War ends. 12. You can use Source of Life to revive dead troops in the Hospital during Server War. 13. R5 and R4 can use an Alliance Truce Agreement on an unbubbled member during Server War. 14.

The number of teleport chances will increase with time (the number of chances will not increase any more after reaching the upper limit). 5. The competition will decide the All-Star Glorious Champion in three rounds within a week! During the All-Star Battlefield, other battlefield games will stop and players can't sign up. 6. The preliminary will be divided into four groups, Monarchs in every group will be automatically divided into four teams by the system according to their power, 50 Monarchs will be promoted to the semifinal in every group. Promotion Rule: Firstly, the Monarchs in the top 1 team whose score ranking reaches top {0} in this team will be promoted, and then the Monarchs in the top 2 team whose score ranking reaches top {1} in this team will be promoted, the Monarchs in the top 3 team with score ranking top {2} in this team will be promoted. Finally, the remaining Monarchs will get the rest of promotion places according to their score ranking in this group. 7. The semifinal will be divided into two groups, Monarchs in every group will be automatically divided into four teams by the system according to their power. The promotion rule is as same as the preliminary, 50 Monarchs will be promoted to the final in every group. 8. Monarchs in the final will be automatically divided into four teams by the system according to their power. The Monarch in the top 1 team whose score ranking is top 1 will be the All-Star Glorious Champion! 9. There will be rich rewards in the competition. The All-Star Glorious Champion will also have great rewards such as Sacred Dragon, castle decoration, march effect and avatar frame. The ranking rewards will be sent after the All-Star Battlefield. 10. We introduced new score rule to Season 6 All-Star Battlefield. Your scores gained from a single Monarch will be decreased if you have gained excessive scores from that Monarch.";

A story relates that Oichi sent her brother a sack of beans tied at both ends, ostensibly as a good-luck charm but in reality a warning that he was about to be attacked from both front and rear by the Asakura and Azai clans. According to the story, Nobunaga understood the message and retreated from his brother-in-law's assault in time.

"general_history8"="In 1862, during the American Civil War, Philip Sheridan was appointed to lead a cavalry regiment stationed at Bonneville, Mississippi.  Facing the Confederate army of nearly 6,000 troops, Sheridan, who had less than 900 troops, used a trick. He ordered some of his troops to assemble and get off at the train station. After swaggering in the town, they secretly returned to the station, and the cycle was repeated. The Confederate general was fooled by the tactic, believing that Sheridan was receiving reinforcements, and did not dare to launch attack on the town for a while, which provided Sheridan with a valuable opportunity to build fortifications. When the enemy decided to attack, they were defeated by solid fortifications.  With his own courage and wisdom, Philip Sheridan created one brilliant record after another on the battlefield.";

Dewey won the battle with small losses.  Admiral Dewey's final rank was Admiral of the Navy. He is the only person ever to hold this rank.";
"general_history61_1"="On September 11, 1777, Casimir Pulaski's first military engagement against British occurred at the Battle of Brandywine.  The British army with double soldiers besieged the Continental Army at Brandywine Creek. Washington ordered him to collect as many as possible of the scattered troops who came his way and employ them according to his discretion to secure the retreat of the army. His subsequent charge averted a disastrous defeat of the Continental Army cavalry, earning him fame in America and saving the life of George Washington. 
"I came here, where freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.", just like the letter he wrote to Washington, Pulaski created the Pulaski Cavalry Legion and reformed the American cavalry as a whole. He has been called "the father of the American cavalry."";

"robber_activity_newtext"="The ancient city walls were illuminated by the hazy moonlight, and the drowsy guard had just braced himself for a fleeting shadow when he suffered a heavy blow and fell unconscious to the ground. At the last moment, he caught a glimpse of three shadows standing on the city walls, waving bags full of treasures in their hands as they leapt down from the city tower.  That was the first report of crime sightings of the so called Royal Thieves 500 years ago. People called them Strong Nell, Swift Nightingale and Eccentric Duke. In the next hundred years, they stole the treasure houses of countless kings one after another, and none of them missed. Some said they are the remnants of the undead army. Others said they are a team of Robin Hood, singer for the commoners and ambitious prince who came together for the test of future king.  Now the letter of Royal Thieves has been delivered to you. They are coming for your treasures! But if you and your invited allies defeat them and pass their test, they will give you their treasured chests, and the Historic General Barbarossa, who has deep ties with them, may follow you as well.  Good luck!";

"kingkong_story1_des"="The mysterious unknown island is waiting for you to explore.";
"kingkong_story1_text1"="My Liege, the exploration team found an ancient map in the relic with an island marked on it.";
"kingkong_story1_text2"="I sent scouts to check the place marked on the map. And we actually found a mysterious island.";
"kingkong_story1_text3"="However, the island is surrounded by dense fog. The scout can't go deep to explore in the dense fog. Shall we fully explore it?";
"kingkong_story1_text4"="Mystery is often the symbol of wealth. Send a team to explore that mysterious island.";
"kingkong_story1_text5"="My Liege, we need to recruit some experienced explorers. Where should we go to recruit them?";
"kingkong_story1_text6"="My Liege, according to reliable sources, you may find experienced members of expedition in the Tavern. Please go to the Tavern to take a look.";
"kingkong_story1_text7"="(Open the door, walk straight in and look around) This place has a real buzz! (Turns to talk to the explorer behind him)";
"kingkong_story1_text8"="Sir, are you sure we can find the professional explorer in such a place?";
"kingkong_story1_text9"="I paid a small fortune for the information that this guy often plays poker over here.";
"kingkong_story1_text10"="The Tavern was noisy. There was a group of people playing cards, and a man looked like he had lost a lot of money. He didn't have many chips left on the table.";
"kingkong_story1_text11"="Come on, come on!";
"kingkong_story1_text12"="Lady luck would seem to be on my side. Come on, flush... oh no!";
"kingkong_story1_text13"="Conrad still lost all his chips. Now he is depressed and swearing.";
"kingkong_story1_text14"="Mr. Conrad? I have found a new island and I think you might be interested in it. (Monarch taps Conrad on the shoulder and gestures aside for a good place to talk)";
"kingkong_story1_text15"="Okay! Let's see what job do you have. (Conrad follow the monarch and sit on the chair aside)";
"kingkong_story1_text16"="Monarch spread out the map directly, and there was an obvious delineation of coordinates on it. But there were no records of exploration around.";
"kingkong_story1_text17"="The Monarch leaned over to Conrad and whispered, "There is a large area of unexplored energy sources and unknown life species, which can be said to be a relatively suitable job for an experienced former army tracker like you. And you'll be well paid."";
"kingkong_story1_text18"="After he finished speaking, he gave Conrad a thick envelope, and Conrad opened it. There is a stack of dollars in the envelope, about 10,000 dollars.";
"kingkong_story1_text19"="'Is that all there is?' Conrad said quietly.";
"kingkong_story1_text20"="Of course not, it's a half deposit up front. I will give another half to you when the task is over.";
"kingkong_story1_text21"="Conrad thought for a moment and said, 'When shall we set off?'";
"kingkong_story1_text22"="The sooner the better! (The crowd leaves the Tavern in groups)";
"kingkong_story1_text23"="Some ships sailed in groups on the sea, heading for the unknown island. Monarch looked at the compass and gave orders to the ships.";
"kingkong_story1_text24"="When approaching the shore, the ship shook violently, and everyone was very alarmed. The weather also became quite bad at this time, with lightning and thunder. Several huge tentacles reached out from the sea, slapped on the deck of the ship and wrapped around the hull.";
"kingkong_story1_text25"="Everybody get ready! This is not a monster we can easily deal with.";
"kingkong_story1_text26"="The team stood apart and picked up the weapons to attack these large tentacles. But with little success, some crew members were grabbed by the tentacles and dragged into the vortex.";
"kingkong_story1_text27"="Large tentacles swept the monarch's ship, the monarch could not dodge and was slapped to the sea by the tentacle.";
"kingkong_story1_text28"="At this moment, a sturdy figure materialized at the Monarch's side, pulling the Monarch back to the ship.";
"kingkong_story2_title"="Chapter 2: Exploring the Island";
"kingkong_story2_des"="Move forward slowly, surrounded with ancient scent.";
"kingkong_story2_text1"="The sea calmed down, and the monarch laid on the beach and opened his eyes. All the members gathered to check.";
"kingkong_story2_text2"="what happened...what...ahem...";
"kingkong_story2_text3"="My Liege, are you all right? We almost died. But the monster suddenly retreated.";
"kingkong_story2_text4"="Oh my God! I've never seen giant creature like that in all the mysterious places I've been to before.";
"kingkong_story2_text5"="(Looks around) How many people and supplies do we have now?";
"kingkong_story2_text6"="My Liege, many explorers are missing and a lot of supplies have been lost. What should we do?";
"kingkong_story2_text7"="Find the team members first. There is strength in numbers.";
"kingkong_story2_text8"="Go and explore the island first. There must be many treasures in it.";
"kingkong_story2_text9"="Yes, my Liege!";
"kingkong_story2_text10"="My Liege, the explorer you spent a lot of money to recruit is missing too. Without him, the exploration would be difficult, we'd better to find him first!";
"kingkong_story2_text11"="The team began to sort out the remaining supplies and equipment and prepared to go deeper into the jungle to search for missing members.";
"kingkong_story2_text12"="Send scouts to check first! In case the previous situation occurs again.";
"kingkong_story2_text13"="A scout team of a dozen people set off to explore first.";
"kingkong_story2_text14"="The Monarch and other members set off later. They found a lot of equipment and supplies of explorers who came to this area before in the forest.";
"kingkong_story2_text15"="The Monarch picked up the military dog tag on the ground. It was already corroded and rusted, and the name on it could not be seen clearly.";
"kingkong_story2_text16"="The further people went in, the more dense the mist was. They couldn't see anything with the eyes. All members slowly gathered together, for fear of an accident.";
"kingkong_story2_text17"="Be careful, I see a faint light, who is that in front of me?";
"kingkong_story2_text18"="We found some ruins here, some murals and large architectural ruins similar to the ancient Egyptian civilization.";
"kingkong_story2_text19"=""Let's go!"";
"kingkong_story2_text20"="The Monarch excitedly called the team forward together. Unexpectedly, while searching for lost explorers, the team found the ultimate aim of this adventure, ancient ruins.";
"kingkong_story2_text21"="They were shocked by the landscape in front of them, which was a huge sequence of stone monuments, on which were carved with daily lives of ancient locals and their god, a huge human-looking creature.";
"kingkong_story2_text22"="Explorers outside the ruins found a dilapidated ship called Wanderer on the river. The boat was covered with moss and rust spots. This place seemed to have been visited by an exploration team several years ago, but no one survived.";
"kingkong_story3_title"="Chapter 3: Repel the Octopus Monster";
"kingkong_story3_des"="Monarch's team was attacked by a giant squid and resisted desperately.";
"kingkong_story3_text1"="The expedition team was still working on the ancient ruins found.";
"kingkong_story3_text2"="They suddenly heard a loud bang.";
"kingkong_story3_text3"="Look! What's that?";
"kingkong_story3_text4"="They all saw a giant octopus.";
"kingkong_story3_text5"="This gigantic monster was reflected in Monarch's eyes. It swung its tentacles and attacked explorers who had arrived earlier.";
"kingkong_story3_text6"="Generals, lead your soldiers to kill this big monster.";
"kingkong_story3_text7"="Yes, my Liege!";
"kingkong_story3_text8"="Archer ready! 3, 2, 1, loose!";
"kingkong_story3_text9"="Cavalry follow me! Charge!";
"kingkong_story3_text10"="Roman warriors never back down. Infantry march forward with me!";
"kingkong_story3_text11"="Soldiers fought octopus monster fiercely! However, the octopus monster was too huge to kill in a short time.";
"kingkong_story3_text12"="At that moment, a team led by Conrad came out from the flank.";
"kingkong_story3_text13"="Conrad and Miyamoto Musashi back to back together to defend against the violent slaps and sweeps of the large octopus's tentacles.";
"kingkong_story3_text14"="I didn't expect an ancient Japanese samurai to be so good at fighting!";
"kingkong_story3_text15"="How arrogant. I've had bigger crises in Warring States Period.";
"kingkong_story3_text16"="After saying that, another slash chopped off one of the octopus' tentacles.";
"kingkong_story3_text17"="Looking at the heroic Conrad, Monarch thought that, "He does deserve the money. I have to make him stay after this adventure."";
"kingkong_story3_text18"="Don't just sit watching! Come on! Let's teach him a lesson!";
"kingkong_story3_text19"="Everyone rushed up together and surrounded the octopus monster.";
"kingkong_story3_text20"="The giant octopus was very resourceful, he dived into the water and escaped away when the situation seems bad for him.";
"kingkong_story4_title"="Chapter 4: Mysterious Guardian";
"kingkong_story4_des"="The Guardian appears, the team is about to see this mysterious creature!";
"kingkong_story4_text1"="Conrad, you're a lucky guy. Coming here for an octopus feast? Ha ha! It's worth the money I paid you to help out.";
"kingkong_story4_text2"="Conrad shook his head with a bitter grin.";
"kingkong_story4_text3"="Now that we have reunited, let's rest here for the night. After all, it's getting late.";
"kingkong_story4_text4"="The scattered explorers began to set up their tents and prepared to cook and rest.";
"kingkong_story4_text5"="Suddenly the rocks collapsed and the ground shook around them. Everyone stopped what they were doing and became alert.";
"kingkong_story4_text6"=""The sound seems to be coming from behind the hill, come with me!" The Monarch said and ran over there!";
"kingkong_story4_text7"="A giant humanlike beast tangled with the escaped large octopus, the tentacles of the octopus wrapped around the beast.";
"kingkong_story4_text8"="The furious humanlike beast grabbed several of the octopus' tentacles and dropped the octopus on the nearby mountain range after spinning, causing the ground to shake violently.";
"kingkong_story4_text9"="Due to the mists covering the jungle, the explorers were watching the battle of the giants through the mists and never dared to approach.";
"kingkong_story4_text10"="The octopus, which had already had several of its tentacles ripped off by the giant beast, fought back in anger and kept slapping the beast with its remaining tentacles. It works, the beast had to dodged around in pain. But the beast moved behind the octopus......";
"kingkong_story4_text11"="In the mist, the giant humanlike beast tore the large octopus into pieces. All the members of the expedition were utterly stunned by the creature so that all stood motionless in their places.";
"kingkong_story4_text12"="After calming down, the giant beast also seemed to sense the presence of the expedition team and slowly moved towards them. But he stopped in front of the members, then scanned them with his innate senses. Suddenly, he slapped his hand on his chest dozens of times, which was an oath that this place is his territory. He dragged the remaining body parts of this large octopus with him, then turned away from the lake and faded out of sight.";
"kingkong_story4_text13"="All right, guys. I don't think that giant is going to show up again for a while, so let's cook the rest of this large octopus to celebrate the discovery of ancient ruins and unknown giants.";
"kingkong_story4_text14"="Conrad walked to the Monarch's side, and the two stood side by side looking out over this uncharted territory.";
"kingkong_story4_text15"="Do you feel that?";
"kingkong_story4_text16"="The further you go in, the greater the sense of crisis. Well, that's the spirit of adventure!";
"kingkong_story4_text17"="That's right! That's exactly why we're here.";

"anniversary6_text25"="The chill wind blew through the northern land, ravens hovered over the black walls, and the duel of commanders from both sides made the tribal warriors excited. They wielded their sharp axes and shouted at heavily armored enemy soldiers.  Then everyone saw the sword cut through the chill wind, the big and brawny tribal commander fell down, fresh blood gushing out and being frozen on the ground.  The victor slowly wiped off blood on Frostwolf Sword, and then raised it up, 'For North Ocean Principality!' 'For North Ocean Principality!' soldiers yelled and charged against the enemy.  According to records, the 33rd Commander of North Ocean Principality reversed the long-standing defensive strategy and launched a war on Northern Tribes to retake lost territories.";
"anniversary6_text26"="No one can stand the bitter cold outside in the North, even the baron of North Ocean Principality who lives here all year round. He was travelling in a carriage with a thick cotton coat and a heater. He planned to escape from the principality. With his fortune, he could live a privileged life anywhere. The rough ground had put him in such a bad mood that he couldn't help but roar, however, the escort captain didn't respond to him. Just as the baron felt he was being neglected, the carriage shuddered to a halt.  'What are you doing you pathetic......' The baron stopped cursing as he saw a tall slender woman with an exquisite helmet lifted the drape, the point of spear on baron's throat.  The baron recognized her Snow Eagle Helmet, which belonged to Valkyrie of Northern Tribes. Corpses of escorts on the road drove him to despair.  'The North Ocean Principality is winning the war under the command of commander-in-chief, why do you take risks to venture out at this time, my lord?' The woman asked.  He shivered and whispered when the woman retracted her spear half an inch, 'He is not the commander-in-chief, he is a Black Blood. The cursed Black Blood!'  According to records, after the outbreak of the northland war, a Valkyrie united Northern tribes, and the outcome of the war was becoming more confusing.";
"anniversary6_text27"="Frostwolf Sword was named for its silvery blade and wolf decoration on the hilt.  It was granted by the first emperor of the Holy Empire to his brother Endymion, and since then it has become the sword of the commander of North Ocean Principality.  One night seven years before the outbreak of northland war, Ernst, the former commander of North Ocean Principality, was cleaning the Frostwolf Sword. This sword will once again touch shoulders of young soldiers, bestowing glory on them and making them loyal knights.  He recalled Ludwig, the only son of his old friend. Ernst cannot forget his bright eyes when he was decorated.  Faced with the invasion of Northern tribes, the brave soldiers either died on the snowy plains, or retired for injuries and disabilities, just like a star dimmed in the starry night. After receiving the report of Ludwig's missing on patrolling the northern shore, Ernst was very calm. Ludwig was not the first one to go missing on patrol, nor would he be the last.  At that time, he received a message dispatched by a raven. It said that tribes would launch an invasion at tomorrow's ceremony. The letter stated the marching direction and strength of tribes, and Ernst finally looked at the signature. 'L.E.', which was the initials of Ludwig's name.  'Jawzahr blesses this kid, he is a shining star in the dark night.' Ernst thought.  Ernst carefully put away Frostwolf Sword and prepared for tomorrow's plan. This time, he would make tribes regret their decision.  In the early stages of the Holy Empire, Endymion led his army to defeat the invasion of Northern Tribes and established the North Ocean Principality after the victory to strengthen the frontiers of the Holy Empire.  His achievements were recorded on the windows in the sanctuary, where Ludwig would often come after training and stare at the window in awe.  After a hundred years, North Ocean Principality has still pledged allegiance to the Holy Empire in the southern land even though it suffered great losses in Black Blood Rebellion and the Holy Empire was in decline.";
"anniversary6_text28"="Snow Eagle Helmet was known for its wings and eagle beak decorations.  It was made by the legendary craftsman in the tribe with magnificent patterns and light weight. Only the most powerful woman in the tribe could wear the Snow Eagle Helmet and gain the title of Valkyrie.  One day seven years before the outbreak of northland war, Nordic Barbarian King climbed the arrow tower with the help of a battleax, looking into the distance. According to the old tradition, he would lead tribal warriors southward tomorrow with another chief Bone Devourer, burning temples and plundering treasures along the way. They would either return with glory and praise, or die in battle and enter the Temple of Wild Hunt, where they can drink endless wine until the end of the world.  The only thing that worried him was his adopted daughter, Alessandra. She had not returned from a trip she was supposed to return 7 days ago. The tribesman who instigated her to go out to look for the Snow Eagle Helmet was still hanged on the tribe gate.  Nordic Barbarian King was clear that his adopted daughter has been determined to become the Valkyrie of tribe since childhood. Thus she planned for a long time to retrieve the Snow Eagle Helmet lost on the northern shore. However, the northern shore was dangerous even for the experienced tribal warriors. What could a young girl do when facing the real danger?  When the Nordic Barbarian King wanted to return to his tent at late night, he heard tribesmen's cheers. A bright spot shined in the distant snowy forest, that was the light of the Snow Eagle Helmet. Alessandra finally came back, wearing the Snow Eagle Helmet and dragging a beast she had hunted. At that snowy night, everyone in the tribe said that they saw the legendary Valkyrie.  A hundred years ago, the ancestors of the Northern Tribes sailed across the ocean to avoid the fate of slavery. When they set foot on this frozen wasteland, their faces were already covered by frozen tears.  Young Alessandra usually meditated in the ancient cave, experiencing ancestors' adventure on frozen land through blood painted murals.  She'd rather be wild thorns than a rose in the garden. She'd rather be a rusty blunt axe than a sharp steel sword. She'd rather die for refugees than be king's slave!";
"anniversary6_text29"="The vast plains in mainland were more fertile to raise livestock and cereal than the frozen north, but never here disappeared the fierce and cruel.  Monsters hiding in the shadow were long thirsty for blood and stumps, their bloody eyes were locked upon the travelers passing alone. Those explorers, who were brave enough though, had been steered by the bandits then the fallen knights, eventually fed the werewolves' appetites.  Apparently, the barons from the North Ocean Principality had let their guard down and been ransacked. Based on the mangled remained on their wagons and horses, the scouts captain recognized it was the furious performance of winged Manticore lions, after which, their impedimenta had been stolen by the Goblins...... Huh? But never a Goblin could have left such a length of the footprint... a human?  The passing patrols reported to the scouts captain, who had just returned from North Ocean Principality that the barons under attack had been saved by the Lord troops and escorted to the main keep. The scouts captain was just sighing the Lord’s ironfisted conducts but distorted his face all of a sudden when the word "The Baroness" from a patrol’s mouth came into his ear. Instantly he vaulted to the saddle and galloped towards the main keep. His panic even caused the guarding city general's suspicion when arrived, finally, the guarding city general nodded his head after captain's desperately repeats warning it might concern the safety of the Lord.  He was permitted to the town center to meet the Lord under the accompany of the vice general. The only thought had came out of the captain’s head was, the baron's departure of North Ocean Principality, was due simply to the grief of the departed baroness with those irretrievable memories left on this broken land. So the baron was impossible to be with his "baroness" when being attacked. So, the "baroness" who came and visited the Lord must be a counterfeit, but her purpose was still a mystery yet.  In the great hall there were two people eating in their leisure. One was the Lord sitting at the head of the table and the other was Alessandra, sitting at Lord’s side in her finery, between them lay a piece of scrawled parchment. The baron himself had already been wounded to death, Alessandra wiped her mouth genteelly and left with her calm, but weak voice 'I look forward to your reply, my Lord.'  At the Lord's behest, the captain stepped into the great hall then solemnly presented the letter from the North Ocean Principality.  ‘Your honor, the flame of the war happening on the frozen north is now devouring our brothers lives, me Ludwig representing the North Ocean Principality now request your militia assistance and support with all my respect. I know that Alessandra, the Leader of Northern Tribes, might be sending their request as well, however, we will always respect your own choice.  So, what will be your choice, my lord?’";
"anniversary6_text30"="The sparks were still flickering on the wooden barricade but Ludwig he stroked it absentmindedly, which gave Ludwig’s battle-hardened rough palm a sudden pain and roused him with his overworked brain.  He had received too many battle reports of the enemies assaults on their frontier sentries each by each in the last week, the overwhelming victories had happened before were like fine wine, swallowed it in whole his soldiers hangover all night, easily forgot the true horror of the Northern Tribes——There is no harbour that their dragon longship cannot go and reach, there is no land overseas that their frozen axes cannot conquer and split. The tribes they came back to the ocean their ancestors dashed and toured, turn into the furious hurricane and thunder and more...  Ludwig went through the garrison muster roll again, the soldiers ordered to defend were all well practiced and disciplined. The opponent leader must have changed the strategy, Ludwig thought, a strategy could beat our elites down in such a short time...  The discussions between the principality warriors had came into Ludwig’s ear, from the different reminiscences of those survivors, there was a same woman wearing her Snow Eagle Helmet. Assaulted each sentry with the Northern Tribes, she was invincible like the Mars and invisible like a ghost. Perhaps, she was the true Valkyrie who came from the Temple of Wild Hunt.  ......Would that be her......  To win time to reform the tribes troops, she designed a feint retreat to disperse the principality focus. To create fear and panic among the principality soldiers, she identified herself a symbol wearing the Snow Eagle Helmet.  She had even made the same decisions as I did, Ludwig thought, she turned to the monarchs and lords on the cultivated for reinforcements....... Obviously, that woman had have grown into a level matched commander as Ludwig were.  Ludwig stroked the wolf head ornament on his sword hilt subconsciously when gazed towards the direction where the palace of Jawzahr the great dragon were in the frozen north legend—— the Mirror Lake Castle.  The complete but overlong coastal defence would only weaken the principality day by day and the true Black Blood would never have their onset till the next year. So he had to adjust some strategies to end the war before the cold winter.  Down in the snowed valley, Alessandra declined the fine wine her underling gave then gave order suspending the marching to take a rest.  The great war was coming, she was bound to stay calm and careful.  She then rolled out the parchment paper map and firstly marked several cross on the islands under Northern Tribes control with her carbon stick, according to the scout reports recently, these islands originally under the tribes control were all assaulted and ruined by the principality troops with no exception, which would definitely be the responses from the enemies for those small tribes troops attacks she had ordered several days before.  Alessandra then here used her carbon stick marked several place with the crosses on the territory of the North Ocean Principality, one and one another, those ones were like burning meteors and stones from their catapults heavily smashed on the castle wall of the principality, which was the proof of the lands retrieved by Alessandra and her tribes principle force as well. Decades before, the Northern Tribes were the true owner of most of land in north, nobody would know the landscapes here better than they were.  The principality pioneer troops were sailing across the sea to own the power of initiative, meanwhile, Alessandra also were leading her troops deeply into the interior back-land of the North Ocean Principality as a sharp dagger stabbing towards the heart of her enemies.  Destroy the leader... and the whole gang will collapse... ‘Ludwig, the strategies you’ve taught me will be exerted back to yourself.’  Thought this way so far, a crafty smile appeared on the corner of Alessandra’s mouth subconsciously.  The date of fierce battle between her and Ludwig had been closer and closer, there would be an answer to the ownership of the frozen north itself in the first snowing night of the coming cold winter.";
"anniversary6_text31"="Jawzahr appeared only twice on the official record of the empire. First, it was regarded as the guardian of the northern territory of the empire living in the Dragon palace located in the northernmost shore of the North Ocean—— Mirror Lake Castle. In the early days of the empire, when Endymion led his army to the north crusade, Jawzahr went with him together towards the frozen north and helped him establish the North Ocean Principality.  Second, during the Black Blood Rebellion, Jawzahr once acted killing the Dragon of Disaster who sheltered the Black Blood clan and burned each evil and monster into coke with his dragon flame, which accelerated the destruction of the Black Blood clan. We had found Jawzahr in the epic sung by generations from the Northern Tribes as well, surprising was that in the epic, Jawzahr had long appeared around hundred years before the built of the empire. When the ancestors of Northern Tribes fled to the North Ocean to get rid of the fate being enslaved, Jawzahr appeared expelling the frost evil long occupying the land, then left it as a long living and developing land for those people.  Of course, hundreds of years had passed since the last recorded time node, and the scholars had also raised more and more doubts about this flying dragon recorded only with a few words.  The most mainstream view was that, the dragon does not exist at all and Jawzahr was most likely an alias for another known dragon species, or for a tribal hero, or even for Endymion and his descendants. But there is no doubt that every time he appeared is related to the fate of the entire frozen north.  Only Ludwig and Alessandra would not doubt the existence of Jawzahr.  In a cold winter night seven years ago, Alessandra, who went alone to the northernmost shore of the North Ocean to retrieve the Snow Eagle helmet, met Ludwig patrolling the same zone by chance then traveled together.  When the two walked to the boundary of the coastline, what appeared in front of them was a huge glacial lake that was like a mirror, reflecting the aurora in the night sky. The whole world seemed to be a stage surrounded by starry night, icebergs and cedars. Alessandra who was young and wild that time, suddenly dragged Ludwig into the ice waltz, but this elegance was soon destroyed by Ludwig who slipped and the two hugged each other on the ice lake. Their embarrassed look made Alessandra laugh since they had been really rolling for a while.  But it was also this very accident that had made the two realize the unique scenery under the ice lake. It was a building alone which reflected in the ice lake and simply constructed of huge ice crystals and gems. In the building, a dragon lying in the center of the aurora candlestick, the shape of its body is like a galaxy, and its splaying wings are like the aurora illuminating the cold night.  The flame of war is now spreading to every corner of the frozen north, and the great dragon who has slept for hundreds of years opened his eyes. Dragon patterns, shining on the ice lake declared the coming of the king, who will rule the frozen north, and will also summon the Jawzahr from another dimension.";
"anniversary6_text32"="Listen, there are two cards in front of you, you can only choose one of them. Choose right one, you can continue to live and fight for everything you want, position, wealth and power. Choose wrong one, the axe will cut your head off. What will Black Blood do? He will call on his two children to choose one each, and as long as one of them succeeds, the family blood will continue to run. The other one? Blackblood doesn't care. If there is no second child, Black Blood himself will take that place. This is the way Black Blood survives.  The northern border ushered in winter, and the whole world seemed to have only gray and white. Regin left the simple tent and walked staggeringly towards the rations arranged by the Principality Army.  His legs and feet were in bad condition, and his stature was thin. If he was in ordinary years, he would probably have been frozen to death in a corner of the tribe, and would become a meal of dire wolf or wild dog, ruining whose appetite. The war in the North Ocean Principality was supported by the military and logistical supply of the Southern Civilization Empire. After which, the Cold Sea was the boundary, and the strength of the two sides was completely changed.  When the army of the Principality attacked, Regin put down the axe in his hand with little resistance.  The food that can be obtained today is hot porridge and black bread. After several days of orderly maintenance, the tribesmen who had stood with the law of the weak lined up into a regular line as well. There were only a few more Principality soldiers in front of the pots to identify the appearance of the tribesmen one by one, they were looking for a key person hiding here. Regin raised his eyebrows. He was not very willing to get involved in such a thing, so he began to pretend to leave the team casually.  Someone pushed aside the crowd and walked towards him behind him. Regin seemed to have forgotten that his legs were not agile, and gradually accelerated his pace.  ‘It's the Bone Devourer!’ Someone yelled, the already anxious crowd began to make noise, the children was crying and the women was screaming, Regin pretended to accidentally knock down a brazier and picked up a torch and threw it into the distance. The tent, he flew towards the border of the wooden fence, just as he was about to jump up, a tall figure blocked his way, his face slammed hard on the armor like ice, he As soon as he resisted the severe pain on the bridge of his nose, he was hit again, the wooden stick that was temporarily picked up was also kicked into the distance. ‘Extinguish the fire!’Ludwig grabbed Regin's neckline after he finished speaking, confirming the identity of the other party with his eyes, he threw the Crow Feather Long Coat and the Skeleton Crown in front of the old man. ...  Ludwig remembered the name Regin.  In the description of the former commander Ernst, he once had a comrade-in-arms named Regin.  After Ernst took over the Frostwolf Long Sword and gained the highest power in the Principality of Cold Sea, this comrade-in-arms encountered an accident on the "blood-stained cold night". At that time, only his infant child could be saved.  Ernst named the child Ludwig and raised it with the goal of being the heir to the commander-in-chief to make up for the lack of old comrades over the years.  To the date, Ernst, who was seriously ill in bed, still holding the hand of Ludwig, who had came to visit him, and told him about his relationship with his father and his family.  What Ernst didn't know was that on the day of the incident, a figure was hiding in the snowy forest in the distance, observing everything that was happening with a cold eye. The sword in his left hand pierced his teacher not long ago. His chest, the dagger in his right hand wiped the neck of his beloved woman, he fought in the Principality of Cold Sea for many years, married and had children, and after seeing that he could not reach the peak of power, he decided to exchange the information of the Principality of Cold Sea to the northern tribes. as a transaction. Putting on the crowfeather coat, he chose to run the opposite direction of his own children.  When Ludwig saw Alessandra again, she had put on the armor given by the lord and was recruited to become a general of his own faction. Before waiting for him to say hello, Alessandra, just like a few years ago, immediately recognized his footsteps and fixed her eyes on him. Then, she came over and spat hard on Ludwig's boot.  'I thought you who a little more elegant lady.' Ludwig sniffed.  'That grace doesn't need to be shown in front of you, the executioner.' Alessandra shot back fiercely.  ‘One to another.’ It was useless to talk too much, Ludwig bypassed her and went to the center of the town to report to the lord.  The war has gone, the entire north land after this war would usher in a long period of peace. Alessandra knew that Ludwig is a reliable comrade on the same side. They long knew each other, but they can never return to the past. Alessandra recalled the northern shore of the North Ocean several years ago.  When she did not need to prove herself and distinguish between both sides and where she could play and laugh freely with a boy. Thinking back on this, Alessandra looked a bit dazed. She looked up at the sky and prayed that time would return to that moment.";
"anniversary6_text72"="My Liege,  This is the latest news from the North, the war between North Ocean Principality and Northern Tribes broke out.  The North Ocean Principality was established by the first duke of the empire to strengthen the northern frontiers. They are loyal to the former Empire, and their attitude towards us is currently unknown.  The Northern Tribes have been invading our border areas for a long time, and a team led by Nordic Barbarian King is even plundering in our territory.  The source of information is North Ocean Trading Company, which has been engaged in trade in the North for many years. They are neutral and reliable.  The outcome of the war concerns the security of the northern border. Please allow me to go to the North to get the latest intelligence.  Yours faithfully, Scout Captain";
"anniversary6_text73"="My Liege,   The commander of North Ocean Principality called himself the descendant of Black Blood and gathered a large number of troops in the past few days.  Black Blood is the general name of descendants of the former Prince, who seized the position of Commander of North Ocean Principality two hundred years ago and launched an invasion against the former Empire, known as the "Black Blood Rebellion".  After the Black Blood Rebellion was put down, the Black Blood had no descendants for a long time. But there were rumors in the North that the descendant of Black Blood would become the new king after the rule of Raged King was overthrown.  The authenticity of the bloodline of the commander of North Ocean Principality is still to be verified.   Yours faithfully, Guard Captain";
"anniversary6_text74"="My Liege,   During my travels in the North, I have discussed strategy and tactics with a young General named Ludwig. I saw in him the qualities that most good Generals possess. Loyalty to his commander, love to his people and no mercy to his enemy.  This young General is highly regarded by Ernst, the commander of North Ocean Principality. He has worked undercover for many years in the Northern Tribes, gaining insight in his opponent and constantly passing effective information to North Ocean Principality. He should become the new commander of North Ocean Principality after Ernst.  I heard that the war in the North has started again. If we can get in touch with him and form an alliance with North Ocean Principality, I believe we can expel Northern Tribes for good.   Yours faithfully, Martinus";
"anniversary6_text75"="My Liege,   I have fought a woman General named Alessandra in a battle against invasion of Northern Tribes.  She is the adopted daughter of the Nordic Barbarian King and follows her father to harass our northern border. I have defeated many tribal commanders, and she is the toughest opponent I've ever seen in Northern Tribes. Her skill of spear blends the force of tribes with the subtle skill of our civilization, as does her style of command.  I would have liked to warn you to pay more attention to this powerful enemy, but after learning that you have defeated her father, the Nordic Barbarian King, I thought we have a chance to persuade her tribe to surrender. If we recruit Alessandra to our team, we can solve the security problem of our northern border once and for all.   Yours faithfully, Elektra";
"anniversary6_text127"="Listen, there are two cards in front of you, you can only choose one of them. Choose right one, you can continue to live and fight for everything you want, position, wealth and power. Choose wrong one, the axe will cut your head off.  What will Black Blood do? He will call on his two children to choose one each, and as long as one of them succeeds, the family blood will continue to run. The other one? Black Blood doesn't care. If there is no second child, Black Blood himself will take that place. This is the way Black Blood survives.  An arrow passed through the narrow castle window edge and nailed to Dr. Hargill's table. In the face of the arrow that almost killed herself, Dr. Hargill just glanced at it, and then continued to head down to sort out her letters for several years. She should have died a long time ago, every moment she lived in the world was a sinful karma.  The former commander Ernst was lucky, he died before the city fall and cannot hear the laughter of his old enemy.  The current commander Ludwig evacuated the civilians and led his men back into the city to resist, but there was little effective resistance left, and if she could, she would not want the boy to bear the name of Black Blood. When the last research report was sealed in a bronze box, this old woman mustered up the last courage, she would speak out the secret buried for many years, to uncover the source of the war.  Hargill has served Black Blood in secret for nearly 40 years. In her early years as a slave, she was sent to learn basic medical knowledge because of her good looks and intelligence, and her outstanding talent made her stand out and once served as a medical officer for the old commander and his successor, Ernst until the "Cold Night of Blood" that triggered the war between the North Ocean Principality and the Northern Tribes thirty years ago. Regin, the descendant of Black Blood, who had been disguised for many years but had lost touch with the supreme power of North Ocean Principality, finally tore off his mask at this moment and hysterically killed his teacher and his lover, and his sword stopped when he swung at Hargill.  'I need a informer in the Principality and a nanny to raise the kid of Black Blood, you are now a good choice.'  Slightly burned, covered in blood and carrying a baby, she was saved by Ernst, and for years afterwards she diligently raised Ludwig as a foster mother, according to Regin's plan. Black Blood and his kid are about to usurp the supreme power of both sides in the North. And the Black Blood Rebellion will once again disrupt the continent.  'So, what went wrong with this plan? You, what did you do?' At the day of the North Ocean Principality fall, Alessandra saved an old woman who was about to be killed by Bone Devourer. After confirming that she was the Valkyrie of tribes, the old woman exuberantly expressed her desire to repay the favor with a big secret. Black Blood forgot that slaves also have their own ideas.  The long service has made Hargill clear the logic of Black Blood's actions, and if it is broken, what would Black Blood think when he finds out afterwards? In the "Cold Night of Blood", she secretly replaced the son of Black Blood and raised the surviving kid of the victim instead.  'Regin's name is now Bone Devourer. Good girl, be careful, he was born to be a betrayer.' After telling the story of her life, Hargill drew his dagger and stabbed herself in the chest.  'For North Ocean Principality!' The blood that burst out dyed the world red in Alessandra's eyes, the old woman who had betrayed the Principality all her life, only to express her loyalty to it in such a tragic way in her final moments, passing away together with it.  Alessandra was sad that Hargill thought she had completed her revenge on Black Blood, but in fact she had not. Ludwig is not Black Blood, she is the kid of Black Blood who was abandoned in the snowy plains. Even if by mistake two generations of Black Blood still achieved their goal and usurped the supreme power of the North. When she learned from Nordic Barbarian King that she had been saved by the tribe's former chief on the "Cold Bight of Blood", and when she confirmed the unique Black Blood mark on her body, she knew her true identity.  Alessandra closed Hargill's eyes with her hand. All that she want to do was to make her own father, who was so evil, pay the price.  Hearing familiar footsteps in the city, Alessandra quickly found Ludwig, who had returned from Ernst's funeral, changed into a suit of armor given by the lord and accepted recruitment to become a general on the same side as herself.  'At least this time, you made the right choice.' Alessandra smiled at Ludwig, but Ludwig passed by with no expression.  The war has gone, the entire north land after this war ushered in a long period of peace. Alessandra knew that Ludwig is a reliable comrade on the same side. They knew each other, but they can never return to the past.  Alessandra recalled the northern shore of the North Ocean several years ago. When she did not need to prove herself and distinguish between both sides and where she could play and laugh freely with a boy. Thinking back on this, Alessandra looked a bit dazed. She looked up at the sky and prayed that time would return to that moment.";
"anniversary6_text128"="My Liege,   An emissary from the North Ocean Trading Company has brought you a gift to show their support for your choice.  Your reinforcements bolstered confidence and improved the business environment. The chairperson of North Ocean Trading Company hopes to have further cooperation with you and your subordinate cities.  On the other hand, we have also received the latest war report from the North. Both sides are engaged in a fierce war on the coastline. However, the scale of victory is already tipped, and we believe we will see the outcome soon.   Yours faithfully, Scout Captain";
"anniversary6_text129"="My Liege,   We find references to the northern dragon Jawzahr in the literature of the former Empire. Jawzahr played a decisive role in several power struggles in the North.  According to the information from the North Ocean Principality, the Northern Tribes and the North Ocean Trading Company, we reached a conclusion that the weak side is likely to summon the dragon Jawzahr as the ultimate weapon to turn the tide of battle.  In order to reduce the casualties of this war, I suggest that we should find the dragon first and let it help us!   Yours faithfully, Guard Captain";
"anniversary6_text130"="My Liege,   The war in the North is drawing to an end. But we have intercepted a surprising intelligence recently.  Nearly thirty years ago, Ernst, the former commander of North Ocean Principality, and the former chief of the Northern Tribes had once decided to make peace.  North Ocean Principality even sent a delegation to the Northern Tribes to sign a treaty to ensure peace. The delegation was led by Ernst's closest friend Regin, consisting of their common teacher and the most outstanding merchants from the Principality. Everything was proceeding orderly. But on the night the treaty was signed, an accident happened.  A statement from the Principality claimed that the tribe had ambushed and attacked the delegation, resulting in the death of all but the Doctor Hargill and Ludwig, who was a child at the time.  The tribe claimed that the purpose of delegation was to kill the chief of tribe and divide the Northern Tribes. The chief was seriously wounded when he fought against several masters of the delegation and eventually died. The tribal warriors who came afterwards started the massacre in order to retaliate for the evil deeds of the delegation.  This incident was called the "Cold Night of Blood". And the irreconcilable hatred between the two sides has been continued to this day.  According to the information we have obtained, it is very likely that the descendant of Black Blood colluded with hawks of both sides and planned this incident. This descendant was once at the top of the Principality and had no less important information than Ernst.  Now that the war is at its end, in order to avoid unexpected troubles, I venture to suggest that we should focus on arresting the Black Blood.   Yours faithfully, Scout Captain";

"general_history267"="The North Ocean Principality was established to strengthen the frontiers and resist the invasion of Northern Tribes.  In the Principality year 103, the Northern Tribes came again. At that time, a young general named Ludwig took up the Frostwolf Sword, a sword representing the supreme power of the Principality.  He led troops to cut enemy's supply lines and recapture several key strongholds. Ludwig also reversed the long-standing defensive strategy and launched a war on Northern Tribes, known as the Northland War. With years of combat experience and knowledge of the Northern Tribes, Ludwig led army to penetrate deeply into the Northern Tribes, destroying their court, killing and capturing countless tribal soldiers. The Northern Tribes have no longer been able to invade the south.  Ludwig the North Frostwolf successfully defended the frontiers of empire with his great military ability and became a role model of all imperial soldiers.";
"general_history266"="As the ancient poem of the Northern Tribes records, only the most powerful woman in the tribe could wear the Snow Eagle Helmet and gain the title of Valkyrie.  After the outbreak of the Northland War, the Northern Tribes fell apart under the enemy's powerful attack, many of their chiefs were killed and the court was burned to the ground. At this crucial moment, the new Valkyrie Alessandra, who came back wearing Snow Eagle Helmet, reunited all the tribal forces and led warriors to retake every inch of the lost land!  Many years later, the achievements of Alessandra, known as Valkyrie, Eagle of Snowfield, Winter Bringer and Star of the Wild Hunt, are still praised by later generations.";

Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the "Xiayi Plan". Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice.  By late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with Chen Ping, Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue.
